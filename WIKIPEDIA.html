        <heading><b>INTRODUCTION:</b></heading>
        <hr>
        <p>Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves 
         characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, 
         a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton.
         Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird to the
         2.8 m (9 ft 2 in) common ostrich. There are about ten thousand living species, more than
         half of which are passerine, or "perching" birds. Birds have wings whose development 
         varies according to species; the only known groups without wings are the extinct moa and
         elephant birds.

        <heading><b>EVOLUTION AND CLASSIFICATION:</b></heading>
        <hr>
        <p>The first classification of birds was developed by Francis Willughby and John Ray in their 
           1676 volume Ornithologiae.[7] Carl Linnaeus modified that work in 1758 to devise the
           taxonomic classification system currently in use.[8] Birds are categorised as the 
           biological class Aves in Linnaean taxonomy. Phylogenetic taxonomy places Aves in the 
           clade Theropoda.[9]

        <heading><b>DEFINITION:</b></heading>
        <hr>
        <P>Aves and a sister group, the order Crocodilia, contain the only living representatives of the reptile clade Archosauria. During the late 1990s, Aves was most commonly defined phylogenetically as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of modern birds and Archaeopteryx lithographica.[10] However, an earlier definition proposed by Jacques Gauthier gained wide currency in the 21st century, and is used by many scientists including adherents to the PhyloCode. Gauthier defined Aves to include only the crown group of the set of modern birds. This was done by excluding most groups known only from fossils, and assigning them, instead, to the broader group Avialae,[11] in part to avoid the uncertainties about the placement of Archaeopteryx in relation to animals traditionally thought of as theropod dinosaurs.[citation needed]Gauthier and de Queiroz[12] identified four different definitions for the same biological name "Aves", which is a problem. The authors proposed to reserve the term Aves only for the crown group consisting of the last common ancestor of all living birds and all of its descendants, which corresponds to meaning number 4 below. He assigned other names to the other groups.[citation needed]

           The birds' phylogenetic relationships to major living reptile groups
           Aves can mean all archosaurs closer to birds than to crocodiles (alternately Avemetatarsalia)
           Aves can mean those advanced archosaurs with feathers (alternately Avifilopluma)
           Aves can mean those feathered dinosaurs that fly (alternately Avialae)
           Aves can mean the last common ancestor of all the currently living birds and all of its descendants (a "crown group", in this sense synonymous with Neornithes)
           Under the fourth definition Archaeopteryx, traditionally considered one of the earliest members of Aves, is removed from this group, becoming a non-avian dinosaur instead. These proposals have been adopted by many researchers in the field of palaeontology and bird evolution, though the exact definitions applied have been inconsistent.

        <heading><b>DINOSAURS AND THE ORIGIN OF BIRDS:</b></heading>
        <hr>
        <P>Based on fossil and biological evidence, most scientists accept that birds are a specialised subgroup of theropod dinosaurs[22] and, more specifically, members of Maniraptora, a group of theropods which includes dromaeosaurids and oviraptorosaurs, among others.[23] As scientists have discovered more theropods closely related to birds, the previously clear distinction between non-birds and birds has become blurred. By the 2000s, discoveries in the Liaoning Province of northeast China, which demonstrated many small theropod feathered dinosaurs, contributed to this ambiguity.[24][25][26]

        <heading><b>EARLY EVOLUTION:</b></heading>
        <hr>
        <P>Over 40% of key traits found in modern birds evolved during the 60 million year transition from the earliest bird-line archosaurs to the first maniraptoromorphs, i.e. the first dinosaurs closer to living birds than to Tyrannosaurus rex. The loss of osteoderms otherwise common in archosaurs and acquisition of primitive feathers might have occurred early during this phase.[14][34] After the appearance of Maniraptoromorpha, the next 40 million years marked a continuous reduction of body size and the accumulation of neotenic (juvenile-like) characteristics. Hypercarnivory became increasingly less common while braincases enlarged and forelimbs became longer.[14] The integument evolved into complex, pennaceous feathers.[34]

        <heading><b>DIVERSIFICATION OF MODERN BIRDS:</b> </heading>
        <hr>
        <P>Most studies agree on a Cretaceous age for the most recent common ancestor of modern birds but estimates range from the Early Cretaceous[3][45] to the latest Cretaceous.[46][4] Similarly, there is no agreement on whether most of the early diversification of modern birds occurred in the Cretaceous and associated withe breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana or occurred later and potentially as a consequence of the Cretaceous–Palaeogene extinction event.[47] This disagreement is in part caused by a divergence in the evidence; most molecular dating studies suggests a Cretaceous evolutionary radiation, while fossil evidence points to a Cenozoic radiation (the so-called 'rocks' versus 'clocks' controversy).

        <heading><b>DISTRIBUTION:</b></heading>
        <hr>
        <p>Birds live and breed in most terrestrial habitats and on all seven continents, reaching their southern extreme in the snow petrel's breeding colonies up to 440 kilometres (270 mi) inland in Antarctica.[65] The highest bird diversity occurs in tropical regions. It was earlier thought that this high diversity was the result of higher speciation rates in the tropics; however studies from the 2000s found higher speciation rates in the high latitudes that were offset by greater extinction rates than in the tropics.[66] Many species migrate annually over great distances and across oceans; several families of birds have adapted to life both on the world's oceans and in them, and some seabird species come ashore only to breed,[67] while some penguins have been recorded diving up to 300 metres (980 ft) deep.[68]

        <p>Compared with other vertebrates, birds have a body plan that shows many unusual adaptations, mostly to facilitate flight.

            Skeletal system
            Main article: Bird_anatomy § Skeletal_system
            The skeleton consists of very lightweight bones. They have large air-filled cavities (called pneumatic cavities) which connect with the respiratory system.[75] The skull bones in adults are fused and do not show cranial sutures.[76] The orbital cavities that house the eyeballs are large and separated from each other by a bony septum (partition). The spine has cervical, thoracic, lumbar and caudal regions with the number of cervical (neck) vertebrae highly variable and especially flexible, but movement is reduced in the anterior thoracic vertebrae and absent in the later vertebrae.[77] The last few are fused with the pelvis to form the synsacrum.[76] The ribs are flattened and the sternum is keeled for the attachment of flight muscles except in the flightless bird orders. The forelimbs are modified into wings.[78] The wings are more or less developed depending on the species; the only known groups that lost their wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds.[79]

            <heading><b>CONSERVATION:</b></heading>
            <hr>
            <P>Although human activities have allowed the expansion of a few species, such as the barn swallow and European starling, they have caused population decreases or extinction in many other species. Over a hundred bird species have gone extinct in historical times,[321] although the most dramatic human-caused avian extinctions, eradicating an estimated 750–1800 species, occurred during the human colonisation of Melanesian, Polynesian, and Micronesian islands.[322] Many bird populations are declining worldwide, with 1,227 species listed as threatened by BirdLife International and the IUCN in 2009.[323][324]
